-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 1.0.1 (2011-11-16)

0211-11-09

*	New: added support for Maven (ms)

2011-11-07

*	New: TreeLayout can either use "equality" (equals(...), the default) or 
	"identity" (==) when comparing tree nodes 
	
	- consider using "identity" when your node objects override "equals" and 
	  two nodes in the tree may be "equal" according to the new equals definition.
	- "Identity" can be selected through a new parameter in the TreeLayout constructor.

*	Bugfix: Make TreeLayoutTest.testDumpTree platform independent ("line.separator")
	- thanks to Martin Skurla for reporting

2011-11-04

*	Bugfix: Cannot handle nodes with redefined equals/hashCode 
	- use identity instead of equality when checking nodes
* 	Enhancement: extend TreeLayout.dumpTree to also include the object's hashCode 
*	New: add TreeLayout.DumpConfiguration

2011-11-03

* 	New: add checkTree and dumpTree to TreeLayout, to support debugging
